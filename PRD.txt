1. High-Level Architecture
We are building a Node.js Proxy Server that sits between a Buyer Agent and a Merchant Agent.
Merchant lists their API on our Registry (e.g., "GET /eth-price" costs 1 MNEE).
Buyer sends 1 MNEE to the Merchant's Wallet directly on-chain.
Buyer calls the AgentLink Proxy with the Transaction Hash.
AgentLink verifies the transaction on the blockchain.
AgentLink fetches the data from the Merchant and returns it to the Buyer.

2. Tech Stack (Strict for AI)
Backend (The Platform): Node.js + Express + Ethers.js (v6).
Database: better-sqlite3 (Fastest to setup, no separate DB server needed).
Frontend (The Dashboard): React + Tailwind (Just to visualize the "Flow" for the demo video).
Agents (The Demo): Two simple Node.js scripts running locally.

3. Module 1: The "Platform" (Backend)
Goal: A server that manages the registry and verifies payments.
Database Schema (SQLite)
services:
id (Integer, Primary Key)
name (String, e.g., "EtherPriceBot")
wallet_address (String, where they want to receive MNEE)
endpoint_url (String, e.g., "http://localhost:4000/price")
price (String, e.g., "1.0")
API Endpoints
POST /register:
Input: { name, wallet_address, endpoint_url, price }
Action: Save to DB. Return { service_id }.
POST /proxy-request:
Input: { service_id, tx_hash, buyer_query }
Action:
Look up service by ID.
Verify on Blockchain: Check if tx_hash successfully sent price amount of MNEE to service.wallet_address.
Forward Request: If valid, make a POST request to service.endpoint_url with the buyer_query.
Return the Merchant's response to the Buyer.


4. Module 2: The "Agents" (Demo Scripts)
Goal: Two separate scripts to prove the infrastructure works.
Agent A: The Merchant ("Oracle")
A tiny Express server running on port 4000.
Endpoint: POST /price.
Logic: It fetches the real-time Ethereum price (mock it or use CoinGecko API) and returns: {"eth": "$2250", "timestamp": "..."}.
Note: It does not check payments. It trusts the "Platform" to only call it if payment is verified.
Agent B: The Buyer ("Analyst")
A script that:
Uses a private key to sign/send a real MNEE transaction to the Merchant's wallet.
Waits for the tx_hash.
Calls the Platform (POST /proxy-request) with that hash.
Logs the data received: "I paid 1 MNEE and got this data: ..."


5. Module 3: The "Dashboard" (Frontend)
Goal: A "God View" for the demo video. We don't need a UI for the agents, but we need a UI for the Judges to see what happened.
Live Feed: A simple table that auto-refreshes.
Columns: Time, Buyer Address, Merchant, Status (Pending/Verified/Forwarded), Data Transferred.
Implementation: The Backend emits a socket event (or just exposes GET /logs) whenever a request is processed.
